# Example Approaches to how to test different aspects of components

Components are split into following aspects (prefixed with a number):
1. Component that don't need a test
2. Component with a content prop
3. Component with a callback
4. Component with a changing style
5. Component with a domain hook
6. Component with an asynchronous change
7. Hook testing
